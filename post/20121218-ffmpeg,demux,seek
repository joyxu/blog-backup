#using ffmpeg to demux stream(video h.264 , audio aac) and do the time search#

[ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) is a very famouse multimedia library.

There are several sites I think are very helpful for multimedia developer:
1   [ffmpeg detail](http://3xin2yi.info/wwwroot/tech/doku.php/tech:multimedia:ffmpeg)
2   [ffmpeg decode procedure](http://www.douban.com/note/228831821/)
3   [An ffmpeg and SDL Tutorial](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/)


Today I want to talk how to demux network stream by ffmpeg, the full procedure is as following:
1   register movie container format and codec by calling av_rigister_all()
2   open the network stream by calling av_open_input_stream()
3   find the stream info by calling av_find_stream_info()
4   loop all the stream and find audio and video by checking the codec_type of each stream(nb_streams)
5   alloc memory for packet of frame by calling av_init_packet or avcodec_alloc_frame
6   read frame from stream by calling av_read_frame
7   check the type of stream(audio or video)
8   after read all the frame calling av_close_input_stream to close the stream

if want to do time search,the procedure is as following:
1   call av_seek_frame to seek by time or by byte
2   call av_read_frame to read packet and do demux and decode

refer source code:
1   [ffmpeg demux/remux]
2   [ffmpeg demux]
